# Hydration Mismatch Fix

## Problem
The application was experiencing hydration mismatches due to browser extensions (particularly ColorZilla) adding attributes like `cz-shortcut-listen="true"` to the `<body>` element after React hydration completed.

## Root Cause
Browser extensions modify the DOM after the initial page load, causing differences between server-rendered HTML and client-side HTML. This triggers React's hydration mismatch warnings.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Suppress Hydration Warnings on Body Element
Added `suppressHydrationWarning={true}` to the `<body>` element in `layout.tsx` to prevent React from warning about known browser extension interference.

### 2. Client-Side Cleanup Component
Created `ClientBody` component that:
- Removes known browser extension attributes from the body element
- Sets up a MutationObserver to handle dynamically added extension attributes
- Suppresses console warnings for known extension-related hydration issues

### 3. Hydration Utilities
Created `utils/hydration.ts` with helper functions for:
- Detecting client-side execution
- Safe client-only API access
- Browser extension attribute cleanup
- Development-mode hydration debugging

### 4. NoSSR Component
Created a `NoSSR` component for cases where client-only rendering is needed to prevent hydration mismatches.

## Files Modified/Created

- `src/app/layout.tsx` - Added suppressHydrationWarning and ClientBody wrapper
- `src/components/layout/ClientBody.tsx` - Client-side body wrapper component
- `src/components/ui/NoSSR.tsx` - Client-only rendering component
- `src/utils/hydration.ts` - Hydration utility functions

## Known Browser Extension Attributes Handled

- `cz-shortcut-listen` (ColorZilla)
- `data-new-gr-c-s-check-loaded` (Grammarly)
- `data-gr-ext-installed` (Grammarly)
- `data-lt-installed` (LanguageTool)
- `spellcheck` (Various extensions)

## Testing
After implementing these changes:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Restart the development server
3. Check browser console for hydration warnings
4. Test with various browser extensions enabled

## Future Considerations
- Monitor for new browser extension attributes that might cause issues
- Update the extension attribute list in `hydration.ts` as needed
- Consider implementing more granular hydration suppression for specific components if needed

## Performance Impact
Minimal - the MutationObserver only watches for specific attributes on the body element and cleanup operations are lightweight.
